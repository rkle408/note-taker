# note-taker

We all have those busy days at work where there's always so much to do... but then there's always that one thing we forget... Here is a solution to that issue: a note taker! It is an easy to use digital to-do list. Writing errands down helps to alleviate your mental load, thereby reducing stress, hopefully will help you get all those duties done more efficiently, and the feeling of deleting a to-do off your list just is feels so good! If you just don't have time to get everything done, don't worry, we'll save it for you for another time.

With every project, I re-learn the importance of paying attention to EVERY. SINGLE. DETAIL. (That extra semicolon and those missing parentheses will have you pulling out your hair!) I learned the importance of staying organized in this particular project. There are many files associated with this project (server.js, store.js, apiRoute.js, htmlRoute.js, index.htm, notes.html, db.json, etc.), and it is critical to remember which file does what, and to remember to link them so they can pull and give information to each other. I learned the importance of also knowing what is in each file to be able to use their properties.
